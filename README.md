# rock-paper-scissors
A Rock Paper Scissors game developed as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The game allows you to challenge the computer in a series of rounds, where you choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The outcome is determined by the classic game rules, with the option to play multiple rounds.

Skills Gained
- JavaScript Programming: Implementing game logic, handling user inputs, and programming the computer's behavior.
- DOM Manipulation: Creating an interactive user interface to display the result of each round.
- Control Flow and Loops: Managing win, draw, and loss conditions, and creating a continuous game flow.

This project helped me improve my skills in writing functional code and DOM manipulation with JavaScript, reinforcing my understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interact.
